Remember to log all activity for reporting purposes. Take screenshots of everything, even if your attempts fail. I like to number my screenshots `1 - blah.png` to make it easer to review screenshots when creating the report storyboard. You should be including positive findings for the client in your report Executive Summary and Storyboard sections.

## Linux Logging Examples:

Log using tee:

`command args | tee output.log`

Append to a log:

`command args | tee -a output.log`

Log all commands run in a window using the script utility: 

`script output.log`

Run a single command and log it using the script utility:

`script -c 'command args' output.log`

If your command requires single quotes in the args, wrap the command in double quotes or vice versa. You can also escape quotes.

Metasploit spool command:

`msf> spool msfconsole.log`

## Windows Logging Examples:

`Get-ChildItem -Path D: -File -System -Recurse | Tee-Object -FilePath "c:\test\AllSystemFiles.txt" -Append | Out-File c:\test\NewSystemFiles.txt`

This command saves a list of system files in a two log files, a cumulative file and a current file.

The command uses the Get-ChildItem cmdlet to do a recursive search for system files on the D: drive. A pipeline operator (|) sends the list to Tee-Object, which appends the list to the AllSystemFiles.txt file and passes the list down the pipeline to the Out-File cmdlet, which saves the list in the NewSystemFiles.txt file.
