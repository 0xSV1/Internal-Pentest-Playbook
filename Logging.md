Remember to log all activity for reporting purposes. Take screenshots of everything, even if your attempts fail. I like to number my screenshots `1 - blah.png` to make it easer to review screenshots in order for esatblishing a report storyboard. You should be including positive findings for the client in your report Executive Summary and Storyboard sections.

Logging Examples:

Log using tee:

`command args | tee output.log`

Append to a log:

`command args | tee -a output.log`

Log all commands run in a window using the script utility: 

`script output.log`

Run a single command and log it using the script utility:

`script -c 'command args' output.log`

If your command requires single quotes in the args, wrap the command in double quotes or vice versa. You can also escape quotes.

Metasploit spool command:

`msf> spool msfconsole.log`
